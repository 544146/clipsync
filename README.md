# clipsync [![Tests](https://github.com/544146/clipsync/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/544146/clipsync/actions/workflows/python-app.yml)

Reddit bot for synchronizing twitch clips with twitch streams, interfaces with reddit via [praw](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw) and twitch via [gql](https://gql.twitch.tv/gql).

Open to feedback, however I rarely work on this project so [pull requests](https://github.com/thomasasfk/clipsync/pulls) are preferred over suggestions please.
